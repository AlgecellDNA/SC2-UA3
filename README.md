# Undead Assault 3
Undead Assault 3 map for StarCraft II. This map was not originally created by me, but rather I inherited maintenance during the 2014-2015 period. Although this was meant to be temporary, it ended up becoming more permanent for reasons I am still unsure of.

Due to a combination of buggy Learn type Ability behaviour and the rise of Undead Assault Chronicles the maintenance work on this map has been largely discontinued. However due to public request a GIT repository has been created for those who want to continue development on this map without going through the hassle of publishing and advertising their own.

Anyone is welcome to submit a pull request. Pull requests will be lightly screened. This repository will be checked at least every 1-2 months, and if changes made a new release version will be pushed to all regions.

When making changes please update the publish change log. Also do not attempt anything malicious to game balance as it might result in your pull request being rejected.
